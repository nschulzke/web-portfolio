This is basically a clone of Jordan Hudgens's portfolio app located here: https://github.com/jordanhudgens/devcamp-portfolio

I was participating as a mentor in a version of the DevCamp.com bootcamp that was being offered to High School students throughout Utah, and completed this along with the students so that I could help them out. I made a few changes here and there where I thought my way was better, but almost all of the code was Jordan's.
